=============

We used this repo to demonstrate how to use Jenkins to manage the scripted deployment of the AWS A Media Manager app.  This fork is not intended to be merged back into the original, and we don't plan on keeping it updated with any changes to made to the original. You will incur AWS charges while resources are in use. Use this application at your own risk!
